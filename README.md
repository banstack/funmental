# Fathom

A daily trivia dive. Every day there's one free 7-question dive on a rotating topic, the same for everyone. Each right answer takes you deeper into the ocean, and the questions get harder as the water gets darker. Get all seven and you reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep, 10,935 m down.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173 (works on its own; progress stays in the browser)
npm test        # question banks, daily deck, depth and oxygen rules, save merging
npm run build
```

To try accounts and sync locally, you also need Postgres:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # point DATABASE_URL at a local Postgres database
npm run dev:server            # API on :3001; Vite proxies /api to it
```

Server integration tests run when a throwaway database is provided: `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... npm test`.

## How it works

- **Ocean zones** (`src/lib/ocean.ts`): Sunlight (0–200 m), Twilight (to 1,000 m), Midnight (to 4,000 m), Abyss (to 6,000 m) and Hadal (to 10,935 m). Each zone is a difficulty from 1 (Easy) to 5 (Expert).
- **Daily Dive** (free, `src/lib/daily.ts`): 7 questions at difficulties 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, worth 100, 100, 800, 1,500, 1,500, 2,000 and 4,935 m. A miss earns nothing for that question and the dive carries on. Each question has 20 seconds; running out of air counts as a miss. Fathom #1 was 9 October 2026, and the day rolls over at local midnight. Topics take turns, one per day. Questions are dealt from a fixed, seeded deck per topic and difficulty, so every device gets the same dive with no server, and a topic doesn't repeat a question until it has used them all. Each answer is saved as it's given, so a reload can't re-roll a question. Results share as a grid of colored squares.
- **Practice** (full game, `src/lib/practice.ts`): endless dives in any topic or Mixed. You have 3 oxygen tanks, a miss costs one, and reaching a new zone refills one. About seven right answers cross a zone; 3 in a row descends 25% faster and 5 in a row 50% faster. Practice also replays any past Daily Dive.
- **Unlock** (`src/lib/unlock.ts`, `/unlock`): Practice is a one-time purchase tied to an account. Payments aren't wired up yet. The server keeps an `entitlements` table, and `/api/me` reports `unlocked`. To test, use the developer unlock on the unlock page, or add `?unlock=1` to the URL (development builds only). A dev server (not `NODE_ENV=production`) also accepts `POST /api/dev/unlock` for the signed-in account. A payment webhook will write the same row later.
- **Logbook & creatures** (`src/lib/creatures.ts`): 14 creatures across the zones, each spotted by a milestone (reaching a zone, streaks, a perfect dive, Practice records). They're checked after every change and never taken away.
- **Storage**: saves live in `localStorage` under `fathom:v1` (`src/lib/store.ts`). A Funmental save is read once and only its profile carries over.
- **Accounts & sync (optional)**: same as before. The server stores one JSON save per user with a version number. Merging keeps the first finished result for each day, so a dive can't be replayed on a second device (`src/lib/merge.ts`).

## Adding questions

Each topic has a bank in `src/content/topics/<topic>.ts`. A question is `[difficulty, prompt, correct answer, wrong, wrong, wrong, explanation?]`, with the correct answer always listed first; choices are shuffled when shown. A question's id comes from its prompt, so editing a prompt makes it a new question. `npm test` checks that every topic has enough questions at each difficulty, that no choices repeat, and that prompts are unique. Adding questions to the end of a bank changes which questions later Daily Dives deal, so add them before launch or accept that upcoming dives will shift.

## Deploying to Railway

One service runs `server/index.ts`, which serves the built app and the `/api` routes from the same origin. A second service is Railway Postgres.

1. Create a project from this GitHub repo, and add a **PostgreSQL** database to it.
2. On the app service, set `DATABASE_URL` to `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (a reference variable) and `NODE_ENV=production`.
3. Generate a public domain for the app service.

`railway.json` sets the build (`npm run build`), start (`npm start`) and health check (`/api/health`). Tables are created automatically on startup. Node 24+ is required (see `engines` in `package.json`).
